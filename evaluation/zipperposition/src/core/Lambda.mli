val whnf_list : term -> term list -> term
(** Apply a lambda to a list of arguments.
    The type of the lambda must be a generalization of a function
    that takes the list's types as arguments.

    @raise Type.ApplyError if the first term doesn't have a function type or

val eta_expand : term -> term
(** Traverse the term, eta-expanding all sub-terms.
    A term [t : a -> b] becomes [fun (x:a). t x] *)

(** Traverse the term, eta-reducing all sub-terms.
    A term [fun x. t x] where [x âˆ‰ vars(t)] becomes [t] *)
